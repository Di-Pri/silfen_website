        <h2>We care</h2>
        <p>
          Sustainability is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting action
          behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always aiming a
          little bit higher when creating another collection. As a young, global
          fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the planet, not only for
          own sake, but for all future generations to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon
          footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making conscious decisions
          concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in
          which we operate.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name,” SILFEN”. We
          believe that this small change further represents a new and greener
          future for SILFEN. We always strive to deliver high quality products
          in better materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will
          start implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and
          we hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are
          all in this together!
        </p>
        <p>
          As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have
          a responsibility. Our focus is to make as green a production as
          possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our
          carbon footprint even further.
        </p>
        <p>Read our principles below.</p>

          <h3>Minimized water consumption</h3>
          <p>
            The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
            worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and
            contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water
            consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative
            impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean water.
          </p>
          <p>
            All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less
            consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our
            cotton, than conventional cotton products.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2020 we introduced a new collection of bags made from a new
            material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled
            material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the
            oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the
            world.

          <h3>Textile working conditions</h3>
          <p>
            At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
            obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
            also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
            it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
            within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
            ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
            suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage
            our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to
            put their children in school.
          </p>
          <p>
            Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as
            well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all
            employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.
          </p>
          <p>All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.</p>

          <h3>Eco-friendly and organic cotton</h3>
          <p>
            Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly
            known as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from
            eco-friendly or organic cotton. Both materials require far less
            water consumption than conventional cotton products. Every nylon
            product is made from eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey
            from raw material to SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as
            possible.

          <h3>Vegan material</h3>
          <p>
            In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
            have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
            material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising
            that these products do not contain any parts from animals.

          <h3>Recycled plastic</h3>
          <p>
            In 2020 we launched a new collection manufactured in rPET, recycled
            polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known as it is made
            from water bottles across the world – bottles that often end up
            discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is primarily
            made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled
            plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of
            pollution irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to
            our customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!

        <div>
          <h3>Green and sustainable shipping</h3>
          <p>
            We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
            our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
            environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
            close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
            much as possible – by joining forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or
            train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of
            shipping, reducing polluting emissions.
